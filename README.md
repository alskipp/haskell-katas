# Haskell Katas

Some random programming problems in Haskell. All code is in the `test` directory.

This project will hopefully serve as a useful reference to anyone interested in trying out programming problems using Haskell with continuous test feedback.

[Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) is recommended to get up and running.

## TL;DR

Assuming Nix is installed, run `bin/test`, all tests will run and will rerun each time a file changes.

## Developing Katas and Running tests

To start a new kata, add a new file to the `test` directory (the file name must end with `Spec.hs`), also add the file name to the end of `haskell-katas.cabal`.

[Hspec](https://hspec.github.io) is used for testing, so a `spec` function will be needed. Here is a scaffold for a new file:

``` haskell
module WibbleSpec where

import Test.Hspec

spec :: Spec
spec = describe "Testy time" $ do
  it "should work" $ do
    pending
```

To have unit tests run automatically upon file save, run the following in a terminal:

``` sh
bin/test
```

Hereâ€™s the contents of the shell script, it runs [ghcid](https://github.com/ndmitchell/ghcid) via nix-shell:

``` sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -xe
nix-shell --pure --run "ghcid -c 'cabal repl test:katas-test' -T ':main'"
```

On first run, the ghc compiler and project dependencies will be installed into the nix store (subsequent runs will use the binaries in your local nix store).
